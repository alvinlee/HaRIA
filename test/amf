AMF Format

There's currently a lot going on in the open source Flash community. On reading the wishlist at osflash.org I noticed there's still some stuff missing on the AMF format. I used the AMF format extensively with some applications I wrote a while back so I looked up my notes on the format. Perhaps they'll be useful for completing the refence at osflash.org:

Flash AMF

Used for:

    * Local Connection
    * SOL
    * Remoting

The folowing elements are defined within AMF:
Type	Tagbyte
Number	0x00
Boolean	0x01
String	0x02
Object	0x03
Undefined	0x06
Reference	0x07
AssociativeArray	0x08
Array	0x0A
Date	0x0B
SimpleObject	0x0D
XML	0x0F
Class	0x10

For terminating sequences, a byte with value 0x09 is used.

Number: 0x00 B7 B6 … B0

Numbers in AMF are 64 bit ‘Big Endian’. Windows works with little endians, so conversion is required.

Boolean: 0x01 B0 (BOOL)

BOOL is 0 for FALSE and 1 for TRUE

String: 0x02 L0 L1 SMBSTRING

L1+L2 is Big Endian, length of the string. String is in multibyte format, prefixed with a 2 byte Big Endian length specifier.

Object: 0x03 [SMBSTRING AMFELEMENT ] 0x09

An object contains zero or more AMF elements that are prefixed with a multibyte string that indicates the AMF elements identifyer within the object.

Undefined: 0x06

An undefined element consists of soley one byte with the value 0x06.

Reference (TODO): 0x07 ?

A reference refers to an array or object that stored somewhere before. It’s probably a mechanism that prevents

Associative Array: 0x08 L3 L2 L1 L0 [SMBSTRING AMFELEMENT ] 0x09

L0..L3 for a 32 bit number indicating the number of elements present in the array. The length of the array is followed by (length) AMF elements that are prefixed with a multibyte string (with a 2 byte length prefix) that indicates the AMF elements identifyer within the array.
       
Array: 0x0A L3 L2 L1 L0 [ AMFELEMENT ]

L0..L3 form a 32 bit Big Endian number indicating the number of elements present in the array. The size of the array is followed by (length) AMF elements. Note that this collection is NOT terminated using 0x09.

Date: 0x0B T7 T6 .. T0 Z1 Z2

T7 to T0 form a 64 bit Big Endian number that specifies the number of nanoseconds that have passed since 1/1/1970 0:00 to the specified time. This format is “UTC 1970”. Z1 an Z0 for a 16 bit Big Endian number indicating the indicated time’s timezone.

SimpleObject: 0x0C ?

To do – meaning unknown.

XML: 0x0F LMBSTRING

The multi-byte string is prefixed with a 32 bit Big Endian number, indicating the length of the multibytestring that follows.

Class: 0x10 SMBSTRING [ SMBSTRING AMFELEMENT ] 0x09

A class element is similar to an object element, but has a class name indentifyer string prefixed to the array of member elements.

*Element containers*

Currently AMF is used with SharedObjectsLocal (.sol) files, Local Connection and Flash Remoting.

SOL file format

Header:

"\0xBF\0”
S3 .. S0
“TCSO\0\4\0\0\0\0"
SMBSTRING
“\0\0\0\0”
[ SMBSTRING AMFELEMENT ]

S3 .. S0 forms a 32 bit Big Endian number indicating the size of the file. The small multibyte string reflects the name of the object shared in the file. The array that follows has pairs of name (SMBSTRING) – value pairs.
